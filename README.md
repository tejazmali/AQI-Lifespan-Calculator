# AQI-Lifespan Calculator

## Overview
The AQI-Lifespan Calculator estimates the impact of air pollution on human lifespan based on real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data. Users input their age and location, and the system calculates the equivalent number of cigarettes smoked and the potential reduction in lifespan.

## Features
- **Real-time AQI Data:** Fetches live AQI data based on user location.
- **Cigarette Equivalence Calculation:** Converts AQI exposure into the number of cigarettes smoked per day.
- **Lifespan Impact Estimation:** Predicts potential lifespan reduction due to air pollution.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean, modern UI with dynamic results.
- **Health Recommendations:** Provides tips for minimizing exposure to air pollution.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully functional on mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** JavaScript (API calls)
- **API:** Openweather API (or other AQI sources)

## How It Works
1. **User Input:** Enter age and location (city or coordinates).
2. **AQI Data Fetching:** The system retrieves AQI data for the location.
3. **Impact Calculation:** The AQI is converted into cigarette equivalence and estimated lifespan reduction.
4. **Results Display:** Shows AQI details, health risks, and actionable insights.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tejazmali/AQI-Lifespan-Calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd AQI-Lifespan-Calculator
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the project.

## Usage
1. Enter your age and location.
2. Click the "Calculate" button.
3. View results, including AQI details, cigarette equivalence, and lifespan impact.

## Future Enhancements
- **Geolocation Integration:** Auto-detect the user's location.
- **Historical Data:** Show AQI trends over time.
- **Improved Health Insights:** Provide detailed health risk assessments.
